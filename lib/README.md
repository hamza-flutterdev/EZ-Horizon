# EZ-Horizon 🌤️  
*A Personal Flutter Portfolio Project by Hamza*

**EZ-Horizon** is a sleek and lightweight weather application built as part of my personal Flutter portfolio. This project showcases my skills in API integration, location-based services, clean UI/UX design, and state management in Flutter.

## 👨‍💻 About the Project

This app allows users to:  
- Search for weather updates by city name  
- Use their current location to fetch live weather  
- Select their location through country, state, and city dropdowns  
- View animated weather visuals via Lottie  

It demonstrates my ability to build complete Flutter applications from scratch, focusing on performance, responsiveness, and user-friendly design.
